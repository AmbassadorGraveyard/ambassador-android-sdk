Hey! I've attached examples showing how to identify a user in our mobile app with the Ambassador SDK.

The attachment includes examples for
iOS (v1.0.5): AppDelegate.m or AppDelegate.swift,
Android (v1.1.5): MyApplication.java.

For in-depth explanations on adding and integrating the SDKs check out these links:
iOS -> https://docs.getambassador.com/v2.0.0/page/ios-sdk
Android -> https://docs.getambassador.com/v2.0.0/page/android-sdk

Let me know if you have any questions!
